R_2.19	Security logs must be ingested into the SIEM solution for analysis and monitoring.

Integrating security logs into a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solution is a crucial aspect of an organization's security posture. To create a hardening rule or process using Ansible to ensure security logs are ingested into a SIEM, you would ideally follow these steps:

Identify the Source: Determine where the security logs are coming from. This could be from various systems such as web servers, databases, firewalls, or application logs.

Set Up Forwarders/Collectors: Most SIEM solutions have their agents/forwarders that need to be installed on target systems to collect and forward logs to the SIEM.

Configure Log Forwarding: Once the agent is installed, you need to configure it to pick up the right logs and send them to the SIEM solution.

For this example, let's assume you're using Splunk as your SIEM solution. Splunk uses a Universal Forwarder to gather and send logs. Here's a simple Ansible playbook that installs and configures Splunk Universal Forwarder on a Linux host and sets it up to forward logs:
