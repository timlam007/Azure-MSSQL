Infrastructure protection	Network traffic filtering	R_2.14	Public network access to Azure SQL server and database must not be allowed. 




Ensuring that public network access to your Azure SQL Server and database is restricted is a crucial security measure. Azure SQL provides firewall settings to control who can access the SQL server. 

By default, Azure SQL is locked down and does not allow any access until you define the firewall rules.

To ensure that public access is denied, you can configure the firewall rules such that only specific IP addresses or Azure resources can access the database.

Here's a step-by-step guideline using Ansible to ensure that public network access is restricted:


Some key points:

In the azure_rm_sqlfirewallrule task, the range 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.255 is used as a placeholder. Replace it with the actual range you wish to allow. This range can be specific IPs of your on-premises resources or other Azure resources.

The public_network_access: Disabled setting ensures that public network access is disabled for the SQL server.

Storing passwords or secrets directly in a playbook is not recommended. Use Azure Key Vault, Ansible Vault, or another method to handle secrets securely.

To execute the playbook, ensure you have the Azure SDK and Ansible Azure module installed. Also, authenticate Ansible to Azure using service principal or CLI-based authentication.

Lastly, always test in a controlled environment before making security-related changes in production. Review the settings with the IT/security team and consult Azure documentation for updated and best practices.
