Identity, access and privilege management		R_2.4	Contained users must be created which are mapped to Azure AD identities.


Contained users, when mapped to Azure AD identities, allow you to authenticate directly to the Azure SQL Database without needing a logon at the Azure SQL Server level. This setup provides the ability to connect to the database using Azure AD authentication.

However,  Ansible doesn't natively support creating contained users that are mapped to Azure AD identities for Azure SQL databases directly. You might have to use a combination of Ansible modules, especially the command or shell modules, along with Azure CLI commands or SQL scripts.

Here's a general approach to achieve this with Ansible:

Setup Azure CLI on Ansible Control Node: Ensure Azure CLI (az) is installed on the machine running the Ansible scripts.

Use Azure CLI with Ansible: Utilize the command module in Ansible to run Azure CLI commands.

Run SQL Commands: Use Azure CLI or SQLCMD to run SQL scripts that create the contained user mapped to Azure AD.


Replace placeholders ({{ resource_group_name }}, {{ server_name }}, etc.) with your specific values.

Note:

Always ensure your SQL script correctly maps the desired Azure AD identity and grants the appropriate permissions.

The exact Azure CLI command and SQL script may need to be adjusted based on your exact requirements and Azure CLI version.

Ensure Ansible's execution environment has been authenticated with Azure, or use service principals with Azure CLI.

The security risks associated with running SQL scripts through CLI tools should be considered, especially in production environments.

You may want to follow this general approach and refine the playbook to cater to your specific needs and environment setup. If you're running these commands on a frequent basis or across multiple databases, consider creating a role or a more modular playbook.


Here's a simplified Ansible playbook to give you an idea:



SAMPLE ANSIBLE PLAYBOOK

- name: Create Contained Users Mapped to Azure AD Identities in Azure SQL Database
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:

  - name: Create a contained user mapped to Azure AD identity
    command: >
      az sql db query --resource-group {{ resource_group_name }} 
      --server {{ server_name }} 
      --database {{ database_name }} 
      --query "
        CREATE USER [YourAADUserName] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER;
        ALTER ROLE db_datareader ADD MEMBER [YourAADUserName];
        ALTER ROLE db_datawriter ADD MEMBER [YourAADUserName];
      "
    register: result
    failed_when: "'Query failed' in result.stderr"

  # More tasks for additional users or roles as needed
