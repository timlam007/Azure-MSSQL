R_2.21	Manulife approved vulnerability scanning solution must be implemented to identify database related vulnerabilities. 



To ensure that an Azure SQL Database instance is scanned for vulnerabilities using a "Manulife approved vulnerability scanning solution," you would need to automate the process of invoking the scanning tool, ensuring it scans the specific resource, and potentially report or log any findings.

However, without the specific name or API details of the "Manulife approved vulnerability scanning solution," this example will remain generic. I'll use a hypothetical vulnerability scanning tool's API in this example.

Below is a basic Ansible playbook structure that could serve as a starting point:

Please note:

This playbook is highly theoretical and depends on the assumption that such an API and its respective endpoints exist.
Replace placeholders (YOUR_SCANNER_API_TOKEN, your_azure_sql_endpoint, /path/to/save/) with your actual values.
Ensure the API token is securely managed, preferably using tools like Ansible Vault.
Consult with Manulife's IT department or the provider of the vulnerability scanning solution to obtain accurate API details and best practices.
Finally, before implementing or running any such playbook, always test in a safe, non-production environment.

      register: scan_result
      vars:
        scanner_api_token: 'YOUR_SCANNER_API_TOKEN'

    # Check the status of the scan (this is a hypothetical step; the actual process might differ)
    - name: Check scan status
      uri:
        url: "https://api.manulife-approved-scanner.com/scan/{{ scan_result.json.scan_id }}/status"
        method: GET
        headers:
          Authorization: "Bearer {{ scanner_api_token }}"
      register: scan_status
      until: scan_status.json.status == 'completed'
      retries: 10
      delay: 60

    # Optionally, fetch and store the scan results
    - name: Fetch scan results
      uri:
        url: "https://api.manulife-approved-scanner.com/scan/{{ scan_result.json.scan_id }}/results"
        method: GET
        headers:
          Authorization: "Bearer {{ scanner_api_token }}"
      register: scan_results

    - name: Store scan results locally
      copy:
        content: "{{ scan_results.json | to_nice_json }}"
        dest: "/path/to/save/scan_results.json"

    # Add any additional steps as needed, e.g., send notifications, fail if vulnerabilities are detected, etc.
