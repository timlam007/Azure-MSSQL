Audit Record Retention	R_2.18	Store the audit and security logs for a period as defined by Manulife's policy.


Ensuring that audit and security logs are stored for a specified period as per an organization's policy is a vital aspect of regulatory compliance and good security practices. The exact implementation will depend on the specifics of Manulife's policy and the systems involved. However, I can provide you a generalized approach using Ansible.

Determine Log Retention Period: You need to know the exact duration as dictated by Manulife's policy. Let's assume, for this example, that the retention period is 365 days.

Identify Log Locations: Determine where the security and audit logs are stored on your system(s).

Set Up Log Rotation: Most Linux systems use logrotate to manage log rotation and retention. You can use Ansible to ensure that logrotate is correctly configured to retain logs for the desired period.

Here's an Ansible playbook that configures logrotate for our hypothetical scenario:

Notes:

Replace your_target_hosts with the group or list of hosts you want to target.

Adjust /path/to/security.log and /path/to/audit.log to point to the actual locations of your logs.

The rotate 365 line specifies keeping 365 days of logs.

This is a very basic example and assumes a Linux target system using logrotate. If you're using different systems or platforms, or if you have centralized logging solutions, the approach would differ.

Always:

Refer to official documentation and best practices when setting up log retention.
Test configurations in a controlled environment before applying them to production.
Regularly review log retention settings to ensure they align with policy and any changes in regulatory requirements.
